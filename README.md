In this Repo, you can find simple Hello world app for flask. This will let you understand how python flask works.
The main app also contains separate file for each operation like one for store another for update and so on. 
This for proper understanding, so don't get confuse with that.
You can use either single app.py file to run the whole project or single file just to work on particular one operation.
